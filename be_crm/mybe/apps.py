# **For Non-Technical Individuals:**
# This script is a configuration file for a Django app called `mybe`. It sets up the default auto field for models within the app and specifies the name of the app. The default auto field determines the type of primary key field that Django will use when creating new models. By specifying `BigAutoField`, Django will use a large integer field for primary keys, which is suitable for most applications. The `name` attribute defines the name of the Django app, which is used to identify the app within the Django project.

# **For Technical Individuals:**
# In Django, the `AppConfig` class is used to configure Django applications. This script configures the `mybe` app by defining an `AppConfig` subclass called `MybeConfig`. It specifies the default auto field for models within the app as `BigAutoField`, which is a primary key field that automatically increments its value and is optimized for large datasets. Additionally, it sets the `name` attribute to `'mybe'`, which identifies the app within the Django project. This configuration allows Django to recognize the app and apply any settings or behaviors specific to it during the project's execution.
