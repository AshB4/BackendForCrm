Downloading the Backend (BackendforCRM) from GitHub:

Go to the GitHub repository for the BackendforCRM backend project.
Click on the "Code" button, then select "Download ZIP" to download the project as a ZIP file.
Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract its contents to a different folder on your computer.
Now you have the backend project files ready to run.

Starting the Backend (BackendforCRM):

Open a new terminal or command prompt on your computer, if you haven't already done so.
Go to the folder where the "BackendforCRM" backend project is located.
This is usually a folder with all the code files for the backend application.
Inside this folder, there should be a file named manage.py.
This file is the main entry point for Django projects.
In the terminal, navigate to the folder where the "BackendforCRM" project is located,
Once you are in the correct folder, type the command python manage.py runserver and press Enter.
This command will start the Django development server for the backend application.
You should see a message in the terminal indicating that the server is running, 
along with a URL (usually http://localhost:8000).
This is the URL where the backend application is running.
You don't need to open this URL in your web browser like you did for the frontend application.
The backend server will run in the background and handle requests from the frontend application.

That's it! You've successfully started the Python Django backend ("BackendforCRM").
You can now interact with the backend application in your web browser, and it will communicate with the backend to fetch or store data as needed.
Please download the frontend React.js application ("AuctionCRM") if you have not done so already.
